## Description
This is the tenth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to create a command line application that can manage an employee database.

## Installation 
To use this app you must have node installed as well as the packages "Inquirer" and "MySQL2." For this assignment I specifically used the 8.2.4 version of Inquirer. 

## Usage
To launch the app, you need to navigate to the folder containing the code and in your terminal type "node app.js"
You will then be presented with a welcome message, and displayed a menu of options to choose from. Depending on the selection you make you will either be generated a table with the requested information or prompted additional questions that will serve to gather the data necessary to fulfil your selection.
